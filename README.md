# API-Genie: Dynamic Response Simulation
## Overview

API-Genie is an innovative FastAPI project designed to emulate and simulate the behavior of e-commerce websites and other applications in terms of response time and payload. It provides developers and testers with a powerful tool to mimic real-world web application behaviors, facilitating performance analysis, load testing, and the development of robust, responsive applications.

## Features
Response Time Simulation: Mimic real-world response latencies with customizable delay mechanisms. Whether you need a fixed delay or randomized response times to simulate varying server loads, API-Genie has you covered.
Dynamic Response Payloads: Generate response payloads that replicate the size and structure of real application responses. From small JSON objects to large binary files, API-Genie can dynamically adjust the payload size to meet your testing needs.
